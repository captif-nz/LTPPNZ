# R Markdown

These pages are in R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When in RStudio you click the **Knit** button and a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# Notes on Website creation

Assuming R and RStudio are already installed and R Markdown is being used for files.

Steps

(@) Create Github account
(@) Create Github Repo (folder) and make it public
(@) Go to settings - Git Hub pages - Source - and make it "Master branch"
(@) Upload existing R files to Repo (include a _site.YML and index.rmd, see following pages)
(@) Create a .nojekyll file (to stop Github from trying to make a wesite)
(@) Create a index.html redirect in Repo master folder to redirect to _Site folder that RStudio is about to make (see following page re direct HTML)
(@) Download Git to computer
(@) In Git CMD (depreciated)
(@)  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
(@)  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
(@) In RStudio Go to tools global options and check it is pointing to the git.exe (mine is at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe)"
(@) View SSH RSA Key while there - copy to GitHub - your_user_ID - Edit Profile (at top of page not side) - Personal Settings - SSH and GPG Keys
(@) Back in Rstudio - open a new project with version control 
(@) Provide the URL for Git Hub repo - this should make a new folder on your PC with the Git Hub Repo name and download all the files back to your PC
(@) Use Rstudio to Build the website
(@) I havent had much joy pushing the website to Github using Rstudio so 
(@) After "Build" website in RStudio go back to the Windows Start Menu - Git CMD (Deprecated) to cd.. and cd into right directory then
git add -A
git commit -m "new website"
git push

And your new website should be up and running at   
https://Github_user_name.github.io/Github_repo_name/  
ie for me   
https://dala009.github.io/LTPPNZ/  


Working in RStudio
- Pull first from Git tab in RStudio
- Make and save changes to RMD files then
- tick and commit in RStudio Git tab
- Give commit a name and push from commit box in Rstudio


And remember you need that redirect index.html in github repo   
and at .nojekyll file made (with nothing actually in it)  


## index.html Redirect file 

You will need a redirect file called index.html that gets loaded directly to the Githun master repo.  This just makes the link to the _site folder the RStudio creates you website in.  

You need to open the RMD file to see the html code as I cannot find a way of displaying it - HTML just takes over.

&ltmeta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=https://dala009.github.io/LTPPNZ/_site">    
    
&ltmeta name="keywords" content="automatic redirection">    
    
&lt/head>    



## index.Rmd

You will also need a file called index.RMD file to act as a home page (It can contain anything)  when you build the website in Rstudio - if you use the _Site.yml file format on the next page.  Unfortunately if you knit this file you will over write the index.html file for the repo-master folder from the previous page.  I am not sure if this could just be called "home" and the yml file adjust - will give it a go one day.    


##_Site.yml file

You will need create a text file in R Studio called "_Site.yml" in the R Project that looks a bit like this below.  It is the structure of your site. 
That index file is not the same as the one mentioned above as a redirect - this a RMD file called index that is built for the webiste as its home page  

name: "LTPP-website"  
navbar:  
  title: "LTPP Website"  
  left:  
    - text: "Home"  
      href: index.html  
    - text: "About"  
      href: about.html  
    - text: "LTTP Summary"  
      href: LTTP-Summary.html  
    - text: "Rutting Summary"  
      href: Rutting-Summary.html  
    - text: "Roughness Summary"  
      href: RoughnessSummary.html  
    - text: "Texture Summary"  
      href: TextureSummary.html  
    - text: "Ratings Summary"  
      href: Ratings.html
    - text: "Table Summary"  
      href: Table-Summary.html  



# And this below is just some practice at automating menus

```{r}

rmarkdowntitle <- "# Test menu title"

rmarkdowntitle

```

`r rmarkdowntitle`
`r 1+1`
`r Y <- "2nd test"`
`r Y `
test
